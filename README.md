## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
- BEM Metholodogy

### What I learned

In this project, I used the 'font' shorthand property and will start to use it on my future projects.  The 'border-radius: 100vh' is the code I used to have perfect border-radius on the button, I learned this on one of the videos of Kevin Powell


```css
h1 {
  font: 800 1.5rem Poppins , sans-serif;
}

button {
  border-radius: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

On the next projects, I'm gonna fix my previous designs on Frontend Mentor, week by week. I will start to study Javascript to be able to progress on Frontend Mentor challenges.
